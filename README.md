# Learn_Answer
Does a brute force search for the correct answer. Then memorizes the answer chosen, so it answers instantly on the saved answer. I'm not really sure whether this actually really counts as machine learning, or more of a rules based system.

## Inspiration
I found that if I already count the dots on a simple math problem, because I already remembered the answer previously, then I don't have to work out the problem that next time I have to solve it, as it has already been burned into memory.
